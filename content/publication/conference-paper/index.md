abstract: We study the impact of distant connections on marijuana use. Using data on
Facebook friendships, we investigate whether connections to states where recreational
marijuana is legalized affect marijuana use in areas where it remains illegal. We find that areas
more connected to legalized states have a larger increase in marijuana use. These results
indicate that even non-local connections can impact behavior. Our findings suggest that
studies measuring the impact of marijuana legalization using a standard difference-in-
differences approach, without accounting for the network, underestimate the direct effect on
the state that legalized.
