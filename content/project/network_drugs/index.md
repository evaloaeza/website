We study the impact of distant connections on marijuana use. Leveraging the
Facebook Social Connectedness Index, which measures the strength of connectedness
between geographic areas based on Facebook friendship ties, we explore the impact of
connections to states where recreational marijuana use is legalized on marijuana use and
workplace drug testing positivity rates in areas where marijuana remains illegal. The
findings reveal that areas which are more connected to legalized states exhibit higher
rates of marijuana use and workplace drug testing positivity even after controlling for
geographic proximity to the legalized states. The results suggest that even connections
beyond closed proximity can play a significant role in shaping individualsâ€™ behaviors.
Our findings of the externality of legalization in one state to other more connected
out-of-state areas imply that studies that estimate the impact of legalization using a
standard difference-in-differences approach without taking into account the network
underestimate the direct effect on the state that legalizes.
